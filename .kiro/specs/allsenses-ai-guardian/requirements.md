# AllSenses AI Guardian - Requirements Document

## Introduction

AllSenses is a real-time AI guardian system designed to protect vulnerable individuals by continuously monitoring environmental, behavioral, and contextual signals to detect potential danger or distress situations. The system operates on a privacy-first framework, automatically contacting emergency services and trusted contacts when threats are verified, while ensuring all actions are consent-based, encrypted, and temporary to maintain user trust and privacy.

The system leverages cloud-native architecture with AWS managed services, microservices design patterns, and advanced AI/ML capabilities to provide scalable, reliable, and accurate threat detection and emergency response.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a vulnerable individual (rider, pedestrian, worker), I want an AI system to continuously monitor my environment for signs of danger, so that help can be automatically summoned when I'm unable to call for assistance myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is activated THEN it SHALL continuously monitor multimodal data streams including audio, motion, and environmental cues
2. WHEN environmental signals indicate potential danger THEN the system SHALL process and analyze the data in real-time using AI reasoning pipelines
3. WHEN multiple sensor inputs suggest distress THEN the system SHALL correlate the signals to assess threat level
4. IF the system detects anomalous patterns THEN it SHALL initiate verification protocols before escalating

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user in distress, I want the system to automatically contact emergency services and my trusted contacts, so that help arrives quickly even when I cannot make the call myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN danger is confirmed through AI analysis THEN the system SHALL automatically contact 911 or regional emergency services
2. WHEN emergency services are contacted THEN the system SHALL simultaneously alert predefined family or security contacts
3. WHEN contacting responders THEN the system SHALL transmit encrypted voice samples, environmental context, and precise GPS coordinates
4. IF emergency protocols vary by region THEN the system SHALL adapt to local emergency service procedures
5. WHEN alerts are sent THEN the system SHALL provide real-time location tracking for rapid intervention

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all system actions to be consent-based and encrypted, so that my safety never compromises my personal privacy and data security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is first installed THEN it SHALL require explicit user consent for all monitoring and emergency features
2. WHEN data is collected THEN it SHALL be encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols
3. WHEN voice samples are transmitted THEN they SHALL be encrypted and automatically deleted after emergency resolution
4. IF the user withdraws consent THEN the system SHALL immediately cease all monitoring and delete stored data
5. WHEN processing personal data THEN the system SHALL ensure all actions are temporary and purpose-limited

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to be modular and scalable, so that it can integrate new sensor types and adapt to different deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new sensor types become available THEN the system SHALL support integration without requiring core system changes
2. WHEN deploying in different regions THEN the system SHALL adapt to local emergency protocols and contact procedures
3. WHEN system load increases THEN the platform SHALL scale automatically using cloud-native architecture
4. IF new AI models become available THEN the system SHALL support integration from services like AWS Bedrock or SageMaker
5. WHEN processing multimodal data THEN the system SHALL maintain low latency and high availability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an emergency responder, I want to receive comprehensive context about the emergency situation, so that I can respond appropriately and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an emergency alert is triggered THEN responders SHALL receive precise GPS coordinates with accuracy within 10 meters
2. WHEN contextual data is available THEN the system SHALL provide environmental information relevant to the emergency
3. WHEN voice samples are captured THEN they SHALL be transmitted securely to help responders understand the situation
4. IF multiple data sources are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize and summarize the most critical information
5. WHEN emergency services respond THEN the system SHALL provide continuous updates until the situation is resolved

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to minimize false alarms while maintaining high sensitivity to real threats, so that emergency resources are used appropriately and my trust in the system is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN potential threats are detected THEN the system SHALL use multi-stage verification before triggering emergency protocols
2. WHEN confidence levels are below threshold THEN the system SHALL escalate through progressive alert levels rather than immediate emergency contact
3. IF environmental context suggests false alarm potential THEN the system SHALL require additional confirmation signals
4. WHEN machine learning models are updated THEN they SHALL be trained to reduce false positive rates while maintaining threat detection sensitivity
5. WHEN user feedback is available THEN the system SHALL incorporate it to improve future threat assessment accuracy

### Requirement 7 - Enhanced Emergency Detection

**User Story:** As a user in potential danger, I want the system to provide clear visual feedback that it's actively monitoring and to detect emergencies through both spoken words and sudden loud noises, so that I know the system is working and help will be summoned through multiple detection methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is actively monitoring THEN it SHALL display a clear visual listening indicator showing real-time monitoring status
2. WHEN emergency words are spoken THEN the system SHALL detect keywords including "help", "emergency", "danger", and "911" using continuous speech recognition
3. WHEN sudden loud noises occur THEN the system SHALL detect abrupt volume spikes above configurable thresholds using real-time audio analysis
4. WHEN either emergency words or abrupt noises are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately send real SMS notifications to designated emergency contacts
5. WHEN emergencies are detected THEN the system SHALL display full-screen visual emergency alerts with clear status information

### Requirement 8 - Real-Time Contact Notification

**User Story:** As an emergency contact, I want to receive immediate SMS notifications with detailed emergency information when someone I'm designated to help is in danger, so that I can respond quickly and appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an emergency is detected THEN the system SHALL send real SMS messages via AWS SNS within seconds of detection
2. WHEN SMS notifications are sent THEN they SHALL include emergency type, incident ID, timestamp, and evidence links
3. WHEN notifications are transmitted THEN the system SHALL provide SMS MessageId confirmation for delivery tracking
4. WHEN emergency contacts are configured THEN the system SHALL allow customizable contact information and notification preferences
5. WHEN multiple detection methods trigger THEN the system SHALL send consolidated notifications to avoid message flooding
