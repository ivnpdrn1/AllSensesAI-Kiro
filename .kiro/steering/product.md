# AllSenses AI Guardian - Product Overview

AllSenses is a real-time AI guardian system designed to protect vulnerable individuals by continuously monitoring environmental, behavioral, and contextual signals to detect potential danger or distress situations.

## Core Mission
To create an AI-driven safety platform that can perceive subtle signs of danger, verify them intelligently, and trigger appropriate emergency responses in real-time when users are unable to call for help themselves.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Threat Detection
- Continuous monitoring of multimodal data streams (audio, motion, environmental cues)
- AI-powered analysis using AWS Bedrock and SageMaker models
- Multi-stage verification to minimize false alarms

### Automatic Emergency Response
- Immediate contact with 911 or regional emergency services
- Simultaneous alerts to predefined trusted contacts
- Transmission of encrypted voice samples, environmental context, and precise GPS coordinates

### Privacy-First Framework
- All actions are consent-based and user-controlled
- End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
- Temporary data storage with automatic deletion after emergency resolution
- Comprehensive consent management and withdrawal capabilities

### Cloud-Native Architecture
- Microservices-based design for scalability and reliability
- Event-driven processing using AWS managed services
- Modular system supporting integration of new sensor types and AI models
- Regional adaptation for different emergency protocols

## Target Users
- Vulnerable individuals (rideshare passengers, pedestrians, workers in isolated environments)
- Privacy-conscious users requiring safety without compromising personal data
- Emergency responders needing comprehensive situational context
- System administrators managing scalable safety infrastructure

## Success Metrics
- Response time from threat detection to emergency service contact
- Accuracy of threat detection (minimizing false positives while maintaining sensitivity)
- User trust and adoption rates
- Emergency resolution effectiveness
