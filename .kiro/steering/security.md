# AllSenses Security Guidelines

## Data Protection Requirements

### Encryption Standards
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all PII and sensitive data
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Voice Samples**: End-to-end encryption with automatic deletion after emergency resolution
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS for encryption key rotation and management

### Privacy Compliance
- **Consent Management**: Immutable audit trail for all consent changes
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only data necessary for safety functions
- **Right to Deletion**: Complete data purge within 24 hours of consent withdrawal
- **Temporary Storage**: Voice samples and sensor data automatically deleted after emergency resolution

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User Authentication**: JWT tokens with short expiration (15 minutes)
- **Service-to-Service**: mTLS certificates for microservice communication
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and SQL injection prevention
- **Emergency Override**: Secure emergency access protocols for critical situations

## Security Implementation Patterns

### Secure Data Handling
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Convert(converter = EncryptedStringConverter.class)
    private String email;
    
    @Convert(converter = EncryptedStringConverter.class)
    private String phoneNumber;
    
    // Consent timestamp is immutable once set
    @Column(updatable = false)
    private LocalDateTime consentTimestamp;
}
```

### API Security
```java
@RestController
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')")
public class UserController {
    
    @PostMapping("/emergency-contacts")
    @RateLimited(requests = 10, window = "1m")
    public ResponseEntity<?> addEmergencyContact(
        @Valid @RequestBody EmergencyContactRequest request) {
        // Implementation with input validation
    }
}
```

### Audit Logging
- All consent changes logged with immutable timestamps
- Emergency activations tracked with full context
- Data access patterns monitored for anomalies
- Security events automatically escalated

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats
1. **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to user PII and voice samples
2. **False Emergency**: Malicious triggering of emergency services
3. **Consent Bypass**: Unauthorized data collection without user consent
4. **Service Disruption**: DoS attacks preventing emergency response
5. **Privacy Violation**: Retention of data beyond emergency resolution

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers (network, application, data)
2. **Zero Trust**: Verify every request regardless of source
3. **Incident Response**: Automated threat detection and response
4. **Regular Audits**: Quarterly security assessments and penetration testing
5. **Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous validation of privacy requirements

## Emergency Security Protocols

### Emergency Override Procedures
- Secure emergency access for critical situations
- Multi-factor authentication for emergency responders
- Audit trail for all emergency data access
- Automatic data purge after emergency resolution

### Breach Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Containment**: Immediate isolation of affected systems
3. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact of breach
4. **Notification**: User and regulatory notification within required timeframes
5. **Recovery**: Secure system restoration and monitoring
