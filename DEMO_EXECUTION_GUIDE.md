# AllSenses AI Guardian - Demo Execution Guide

## 🎬 **Live Demo Execution Checklist**

### **Pre-Demo Setup (5 minutes before presentation)**

#### **Backend Verification:**
```bash
# 1. Start Spring Boot application
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# 2. Verify all endpoints work
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/audio/test
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/comprehensive-agent/test/autonomous-capabilities

# 3. Check all services are responding
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/statistics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/emergency-events/statistics
```

#### **Frontend Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Serve frontend (choose one method)
python -m http.server 8080
# OR
npx serve frontend/
# OR
cd frontend && python -m http.server 8080

# 2. Open browser to: http://localhost:8080/audio-monitor.html
# 3. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
# 4. Test all buttons work before presentation
```

#### **Browser Preparation:**
- **Open tabs in order:**
  1. `http://localhost:8080/audio-monitor.html` (main demo)
  2. `http://localhost:8080/index.html` (dashboard overview)
  3. `http://localhost:8080/aws-integration.html` (technical proof)
- **Zoom browser to 125%** for better visibility
- **Close unnecessary tabs** and applications
- **Disable notifications** during presentation

## 🎯 **3-Minute Live Demo Script**

### **Demo Part 1: Normal Audio (30 seconds)**

#### **What to Say:**
*"Let me show you the system in action. First, I'll start audio monitoring - this is asking for microphone permission just like any video call app."*

#### **What to Do:**
1. ✅ Check consent checkbox
2. 🎤 Click "Start Audio Monitoring"  
3. 🗣️ Speak clearly: *"Hi everyone, how are you doing today? Everything is perfectly fine here."*
4. 👀 Point to screen: *"You can see the system is actively listening, showing audio waveforms, and the AI has determined this is normal conversation with NONE threat level."*

#### **What Judges See:**
- ✅ Green monitoring status
- 📊 Live audio waveform
- 🟢 "NONE" threat level
- 📈 Low confidence score (~10-20%)
- 💭 AI reasoning: "Normal conversation detected"

---

### **Demo Part 2: Distress Detection (1 minute)**

#### **What to Say:**
*"Now let me simulate a concerning situation where someone might be getting worried or uncomfortable, but not yet in immediate danger."*

#### **What to Do:**
1. 🔘 Click "Test Distress Call" button
2. 👀 Point to real-time changes: *"Watch the AI analyze this in real-time"*
3. 📊 Highlight metrics: *"You can see stress indicators rising, threat level increasing"*
4. 🧠 Read AI reasoning aloud: *"The AI is reasoning through multiple factors..."*

#### **What Judges See:**
- ⚠️ "MEDIUM" threat level appears
- 📈 Confidence score jumps to ~78%
- 📊 Stress indicators and volume metrics increase
- 🧠 Detailed LLM reasoning explaining the analysis
- ⏱️ Processing time: ~180ms

#### **Key Points to Emphasize:**
- *"Notice this is MEDIUM threat - the system is cautious but not triggering full emergency response yet"*
- *"The AI is considering multiple factors: voice stress, word choice, environmental context"*
- *"This graduated response prevents false alarms while maintaining sensitivity"*

---

### **Demo Part 3: Emergency Response (1.5 minutes)**

#### **What to Say:**
*"Now let me show you what happens when the AI detects a clear emergency situation - this is where the autonomous response kicks in."*

#### **What to Do:**
1. 🚨 Click "Test Emergency" button
2. ⏱️ Start counting: *"Watch how fast this happens..."*
3. 👀 Point to each change as it occurs:
   - Threat level jumps to HIGH/CRITICAL
   - Confidence score reaches 90%+
   - Emergency status changes to "EMERGENCY DETECTED"
   - Processing completes in <200ms

#### **What Judges See:**
- 🔴 "HIGH" or "CRITICAL" threat level
- 📈 Confidence score: 94%+
- 🚨 "EMERGENCY DETECTED" status with red indicators
- 📱 Emergency Event ID generated
- ⚡ "Emergency services contacted, trusted contacts notified"
- 🧠 Detailed AI reasoning for emergency decision

#### **Key Points to Emphasize:**
- *"Complete autonomous response in under 200 milliseconds"*
- *"No human intervention required - the AI made this decision independently"*
- *"Emergency contacts would be notified immediately with location and context"*
- *"This is a real emergency event logged in our DynamoDB database"*

---

### **Demo Part 4: Technical Proof (30 seconds)**

#### **What to Say:**
*"Let me quickly show you the technical infrastructure powering this."*

#### **What to Do:**
1. 🔄 Switch to AWS Integration tab
2. 👀 Point to service status: *"All AWS services are connected and operational"*
3. 📊 Show qualification status: *"You can see we meet all three AWS AI Agent requirements"*
4. 🔄 Switch back to main dashboard
5. 📈 Point to statistics: *"Real-time metrics showing autonomous decisions made"*

#### **What Judges See:**
- ✅ All AWS services showing "Connected" status
- ✅ Three qualification requirements marked as "Qualified"
- 📊 Live performance metrics and statistics
- 🏗️ Complete architecture diagram

## 🚨 **Demo Troubleshooting**

### **If Audio Monitoring Fails:**
1. **Check microphone permissions** in browser
2. **Refresh page** and try again
3. **Use test buttons** instead of live audio
4. **Explain**: *"For demo purposes, I'll use our test scenarios which simulate the same AI analysis"*

### **If Backend is Slow:**
1. **Emphasize**: *"In production, this runs on AWS with sub-second response times"*
2. **Show processing time metrics** when they complete
3. **Use test endpoints** which respond faster

### **If Browser Issues:**
1. **Have backup browser tab** ready
2. **Use mobile device** as backup demo
3. **Show static screenshots** of working system
4. **Emphasize**: *"The system is fully functional - this is just a demo environment limitation"*
