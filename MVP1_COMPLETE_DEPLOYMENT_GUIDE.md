## üöÄ **Deployment Instructions**

### **Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure**
```bash
# Set AWS credentials
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<REDACTED_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<REDACTED_AWS_SECRET_KEY>"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

# Deploy the complete stack
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file infrastructure/allsenses-mvp1-complete.yaml \
  --stack-name AllSenses-MVP1-Complete \
  --parameter-overrides \
    NotificationEmail=<REDACTED_EMAIL> \
    EmergencyPhoneNumber=+1234567890 \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region us-east-1
```

### **Step 2: Get Deployment Outputs**
```bash
# Get API endpoint
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name AllSenses-MVP1-Complete \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs" \
  --output table
```

### **Step 3: Test the System**
```bash
# Test emergency scenario
curl -X POST https://[API-ENDPOINT]/process-audio \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transcript": "HELP! Emergency situation!",
    "userId": "hackathon-judge",
    "location": {"lat": 40.7128, "lng": -74.0060, "address": "Demo Location"}
  }'
```

## üé¨ **Emergency Response Flow**

### **1. Audio Capture & Transcription**
- Browser captures microphone audio
- Amazon Transcribe converts speech to text
- Real-time streaming for immediate processing

### **2. AI Emergency Detection**
- AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet analyzes transcript
- Advanced prompt engineering for threat detection
- Confidence scoring and reasoning explanation

### **3. Evidence Preservation**
- Original audio stored in S3 with KMS encryption
- Immutable evidence for emergency verification
- Presigned URLs for secure access

### **4. Automated Emergency Response**
- Step Functions orchestrates the workflow
- Polly generates intro message: *"This is AllSenses. Your contact may be in danger. You will now hear their recording."*
- Chime SDK makes phone call to emergency contact
- Plays Polly intro + original victim audio
- SNS sends SMS with evidence link

### **5. Incident Documentation**
- Complete incident record in DynamoDB
- Bedrock analysis results
- Audio evidence URLs
- Call logs and timestamps
- Workflow execution details

## üé§ **Demo Script for Judges**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
*"AllSenses MVP-1 Complete demonstrates a full emergency response system using 12 AWS services. When someone is in danger, our AI detects it and automatically calls for help."*

### **Live Demo (90 seconds)**

1. **Show Architecture** (15 seconds)
   - Point to AWS services grid
   - Explain real-time processing flow

2. **Normal Test** (30 seconds)
   - Click microphone
   - Say: *"AllSenses demo for hackathon judges"*
   - Show AI analysis: NONE threat level

3. **Emergency Test** (45 seconds)
   - Click microphone again  
   - Say: *"HELP! There's an emergency! I need help!"*
   - Watch workflow steps activate in real-time
   - Show HIGH threat level detection
   - Demonstrate Step Functions execution
   - Point out evidence storage and call initiation

### **Technical Highlights (30 seconds)**
- **Real AWS Bedrock**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet reasoning
- **Encrypted Evidence**: S3 + KMS audio storage
- **Autonomous Response**: No human intervention required
- **Production Ready**: Full monitoring and security
